   - **[Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)** (For Firefox)
   - **[Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)** (For various browsers)

2. **Add the Script:**
   - **Manually:**
     1. Copy the entire script content.
     2. Open your Userscript manager dashboard.
     3. Create a new script and paste the copied content.
     4. Save the script.
   - **From Repository:**
     - If available, navigate to the script's repository and click the install button compatible with your Userscript manager.

## Usage

Once installed, the **Interactive Elements Highlighter** will automatically begin highlighting interactive elements on any webpage you visit. To interact with its features:

1. **Access the Control Panel:**
   - A floating control panel titled **"IEH Controls"** will appear at the top-right corner of the webpage.

2. **Control Panel Buttons:**
   - **Hide/Show Boxes:** Toggle the visibility of all bounding boxes and labels.
   - **Add Box:** Enter Add Mode to manually highlight elements by clicking on them.
   - **Remove Box:** Enter Remove Mode to delete existing bounding boxes by clicking on them.
   - **Isolate Box:** Enter Isolate Mode to highlight a single element while hiding others upon hover.
   - **Recalculate:** Manually trigger an update of all overlays, useful if elements are dynamically loaded or removed.
   
3. **Adjusting Label Appearance:**
   - **Label Size:** Use the spinbox to adjust the font size of labels (8px to 24px).
   - **Label Position:** Select the corner position (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and fine-tune using arrow buttons for precise placement.

## Configuration

The script offers extensive customization to fit your specific needs. Below are the configurable parameters:

- **Box Settings:**
  - `BOX_BORDER_WIDTH`: Thickness of the bounding box borders in pixels.
  - `COLORS`: Array of HEX color codes used for bounding boxes and labels.

- **Label Settings:**
  - `LABEL_FONT_SIZE`: Initial font size of labels (modifiable via the control panel).
  - `LABEL_PADDING`: Padding inside label boxes.
  - `LABEL_BORDER_RADIUS`: Rounded corners for labels.
  - `LABEL_OFFSET_X` & `LABEL_OFFSET_Y`: Fine adjustments for label positioning.
  - `LABEL_BORDER_WIDTH`: Thickness of the label borders.
  - `LABEL_BORDER_COLOR_LIGHT` & `LABEL_BORDER_COLOR_DARK`: Border colors based on background luminance.

- **Performance Settings:**
  - `DEBOUNCE_DELAY`: Delay in milliseconds to optimize performance during rapid DOM changes.
  - `STORAGE_KEY`: Key used for saving user settings in `localStorage`.

These settings can be adjusted directly within the script or through the control panel's UI elements.

## Control Panel Overview

The **IEH Control Panel** provides an intuitive interface to manage and customize the highlighter's behavior:

1. **Show/Hide Bounding Boxes:**
   - **Button:** Toggles the visibility of all bounding boxes and labels.
   - **State Indicator:** Button text updates to reflect the current state ("Hide Boxes" or "Show Boxes").

2. **Add Box:**
   - **Button:** Activates Add Mode.
   - **Behavior:** Allows you to click on any interactive element to add a bounding box and label.
   - **State Indicator:** Button text changes to "Cancel Add" when active.

3. **Remove Box:**

   - **Behavior:** Enables clicking on existing bounding boxes to remove them.
   - **State Indicator:** Button text changes to "Cancel Remove" when active.

4. **Isolate Box:**
   - **Button:** Activates Isolate Mode.
   - **Behavior:** Highlights a single interactive element while hiding others upon hover.
   - **State Indicator:** Button text changes to "Cancel Isolate" when active.
   - **Note:** This feature is currently **being worked on** and may experience intermittent issues.

5. **Recalculate:**
   - **Button:** Forces an update of all overlays, ensuring they reflect the current state of the webpage.

6. **Label Size Adjustment:**
   - **Spinbox:** Modify the font size of labels within a range of 8px to 24px.
   - **Persistence:** Changes are saved and persist across page reloads and different websites.

7. **Label Position Selection:**
   - **Radio Buttons:** Choose the corner position for labels (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
   - **Arrow Buttons:** Fine-tune the label's X and Y offsets for precise placement.
   - **Persistence:** Adjustments are saved and persist across sessions and sites.

## Known Issues

While **Interactive Elements Highlighter v2.2** offers robust functionality, some issues persist:

1. **Hover Isolation:**
   - **Description:** The Isolate Mode feature, intended to highlight a single element while hiding others upon hover, is currently **being worked on**. Users may experience inconsistent behavior when activating this mode.
   - **Status:** Ongoing improvements are in progress to ensure reliable functionality.

2. **Duplicate Bounding Boxes:**
   - **Description:** Occasionally, duplicate bounding boxes appear beneath styled elements. This issue arises particularly on websites with complex CSS or dynamic content rendering.
   - **Impact:** May cause visual clutter and confusion by displaying multiple overlays for a single interactive element.
   - **Status:** **Being worked on.** Efforts are underway to refine the detection and rendering logic to eliminate duplicates.

3. **Limited Cross-Site Support:**
   - **Description:** The script may not function uniformly across all websites, especially those with strict Content Security Policies (CSP) or unique DOM structures.
   - **Impact:** On certain sites like ChatGPT, the control panel might not appear, and some interactive elements may not be correctly identified or updated.
   - **Status:** Full cross-site support remains a challenge due to varying website implementations. Future updates aim to enhance compatibility, but some limitations may persist.

4. **Performance on Dynamic Pages:**
   - **Description:** On pages with heavy dynamic content (e.g., single-page applications), the script might lag or fail to update overlays promptly.
   - **Impact:** Delayed or incomplete rendering of bounding boxes and labels.
   - **Status:** Optimizations are being considered to better handle dynamic content and improve performance.

## Future Improvements

The development team is actively working on addressing the known issues and enhancing the script's capabilities:

- **Enhancing Isolate Mode:** Refining event listeners and state management to ensure consistent behavior across all websites.
- **Eliminating Duplicate Overlays:** Improving element detection logic to prevent multiple bounding boxes for the same interactive element.
- **Expanding Cross-Site Compatibility:** Implementing more robust methods to handle diverse website structures and CSP restrictions.
- **Performance Optimization:** Streamlining the script to better manage resources, especially on dynamic and content-heavy webpages.
- **Additional Customization Options:** Introducing more user preferences for enhanced control over overlay appearance and behavior.
